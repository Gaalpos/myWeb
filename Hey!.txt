Hey!
It's been a while for sure, but I needed to talk about something.
I have this idea in my mind that my life is ruled by stages. Everything in my life runs based on stages: my hobbies, videogames, ideas, etc. I can focus on one thing for a few weeks and then totally forget about it until next time. For instance, I can play almost only PUBG for 2 weeks and then spend 1 month without playing it. That applies to many other areas of my life.

This stage hasn't been the best, to be honest. I haven't coded a single day since the Easter holidays, which isn't good. I mean, I still like to design websites, but I simply haven't gotten around to doing it. I want and I need to code again, its very fun sometimes. As an ADD i love to get inmsersed in one task and spend hours there.
