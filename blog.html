                            <h6> Feb 22, 2024 - 19:00</h6>
                            I think this is the first time in my life I really feel pressure for my studies. I have 5
                            exams left, and I don't even know if I'm capable of doing all of them right.
                            <p></p>
                            Tomorrow we have Android, which is not that hard, but for some reason, I haven't been up to
                            date with all the work we did in class. There are a lot of things to know, and as always, I
                            left almost everything for the last day (ADDs will understand).
                            <p></p>
                            Next week, we have PSP on Monday, Business Management Systems on Friday, and Data Access on
                            Wednesday. The last one is especially challenging for me. I need to do the final task, and
                            it is a big one, but I haven't started yet. I don't like databases, oh my god, they are so
                            boring. I just want to design cool websites, please.
                            <p></p>
                            I need to study more for PSP but it's doable. BMSâ€™s easy, just a bit of Python. The last
                            big exam is the SQL recovery exam on March 4th. As I said, I don't like databases, I just
                            fall asleep every time I think about SQL (/s), but in order to go to work practices, I need
                            to pass this exam too. It's not that hard, to be honest, the teacher cares about his
                            students passing, so I just need to extract all the energy inside me and do my best.
                            <p></p>
                            I think I can at least pass PSP and BMS on the first try. Android and Data Access may need
                            to wait for the final exams.
                            <p></p>
                            As I started saying, I for the first time really feel the pressure. I really want to finish
                            this to go for the next chapter in my life. I need this, to be honest. I need to grow as a
                            person, which I think I've done a lot lately, but not enough given my stage in life.
                            <p></p>
                            I'm really excited to work in something I like, to keep learning, and to be able to develop
                            my own apps. I hope one day I can work as an independent developer working on my own
                            projects. I really like that future.
                            <p></p>
                            I have dozens of cool ideas I want to do, which is very exciting. It's amazing to enjoy
                            working hard on something, learning new things, and solving projects while having fun. It's
                            something I want to do as living (not talking just about programming here, talking about
                            working on something that makes you happy).
                            <p></p>
                            I think this career can be amazing for someone like me. There are a ton of technologies to
                            learn, things to improve, projects to do, it never ends. I also see myself as a
                            programming-related content creator. That would blend two things I like together, helping me
                            to grow as a developer and content creator at the same time.
                            <p></p>
                            I should be studying Android right now, but I needed to write all of this (and probably more
                            that's not even here), so I think it's time to wrap things up for today.
                            <p></p>
                            I really really want to finish this course and keep walking towards the future I want to
                            have.
                            <p></p>
                            Thanks for reading all of that, fellow human, I wish you all the best!
                            <p></p>
